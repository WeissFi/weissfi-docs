## How Does Earn Work?

**WeissFi** allows users to earn sustainable yield by depositing **DORI** into **Stability Pools**. Unlike traditional lending protocols that rely on inflationary token rewards, WeissFi provides **real yield** generated from borrower interest payments and liquidation gains.

### With Earn, you can:

- **Earn Interest from Borrowers**  
  80% of borrower-paid interest is distributed to depositors in DORI, ensuring market-driven returns.

- **Real Yield â€“ No Token Emissions**  
  Unlike other protocols that print tokens to reward depositors, WeissFi ensures a sustainable yield sourced directly from protocol fees and liquidations.

- **Instant Withdrawals & No Lockups**  
  Withdraw your DORI at any time, with no vesting periods or delays, keeping full control over your funds.

- **Earn on Market Dynamics**  
  Since interest rates are set by borrowers, depositors benefit from a yield that fluctuates with market conditions, ensuring optimal returns.
