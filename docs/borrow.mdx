## How Does Borrowing Work?

**WeissFi** enables users to borrow the **DORI** stablecoin against their **collateral** (currently SUI) with **user-defined interest rates**. Unlike traditional DeFi lending platforms, WeissFi gives borrowers **full control** over the interest they pay, making it a flexible and capital-efficient borrowing solution.

### Unlike traditional lending platforms, WeissFi lets you:

- **Instant Liquidity** – Borrow DORI immediately against your collateral while maintaining exposure to the asset.
- **Choose your interest rate** – You decide the interest rate for your loan, allowing for optimal financial planning.
- **Efficient Liquidations** – WeissFi utilizes Stability Pools to absorb liquidated debt, protecting borrowers from sudden liquidations.
- **No Fixed Repayment Schedule** – Repay your loan at any time, as long as you maintain a healthy Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio.
- **No Counterparty Risk** – WeissFi is a fully decentralized protocol running on the Sui blockchain.
- **Avoid Unpredictable Interest Hikes** – Unlike traditional lending platforms where interest rates fluctuate based on external governance or algorithmic adjustments, WeissFi allows borrowers to set their own interest rate.

## How to Borrow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Select the Collateral

- Select the **asset** you want to use as collateral.

### Step 2: Enter the Collateral Amount

- Enter the amount of **collateral** you want to use (currently SUI).
- Your collateral determines how much **DORI** you can borrow.

### Step 3: Choose Loan Amount

- Enter the amount of **DORI** you wish to borrow.
- Monitor:
  - **LTV (Loan-to-Value Ratio)**
  - **Liquidation Price**

<img src="/img/step3.png" alt="Enter Loan Amount example" width="full" rounded="20px" />

> - **LTV** measures how much you borrow relative to your collateral. A higher LTV means higher risk.  
> - **Liquidation Price** is the collateral price at which your loan will be liquidated if your collateral becomes insufficient.

### Step 4: Select Your Interest Rate

- Set the interest rate you’re willing to pay.
- Lower rates reduce your borrowing cost but **increase redemption risk**.

> **Redemption Risk**: If DORI depegs and creates arbitrage opportunities, users can redeem DORI for your collateral. Redemption fees start at 0.5% + dynamic rate that halves every 6 hours to protect against large redemptions.

### Step 5: Review & Sign

- Check the loan summary:
  - ✅ Collateral
  - ✅ Loan amount
  - ✅ Interest rate
  - ✅ Total Debt = Loan Value + (0.75% Borrowing Fee) + (15-Day Average Protocol Interest)
- Click **Confirm & Sign** to finalize your loan.
- You receive **DORI** directly in your wallet and can use it immediately.

## Glossary

### Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio

**Definition**: The ratio between the amount of **DORI borrowed** and the **deposited collateral** (in USD).

**Example**:

- SUI Price: $3.9674  
- Collateral: 2,000 SUI  
- Collateral Value: 2,000 × 3.9674 = **$7,934.80**  
- Borrowed Amount: 2,000 DORI


> 🔺 Higher LTV = Higher liquidation risk.

---

### Liquidation Price

**Definition**: The SUI price at which your collateral is no longer sufficient to cover your borrowed DORI.


**Example**:

- SUI Price: $3.9674  
- Collateral: 2,000 SUI  
- Borrowed Amount: 2,000 DORI  
- Max LTV = 83.33%


> If the price of SUI drops below **$1.19**, your position will be liquidated.

---

### Redemption Mode 

If DORI loses its $1 peg, holders can **redeem DORI for SUI** via the redemption mechanism.

- Affects **only** the borrowers with the **lowest collateralization ratio**.
- The redeemer reduces the **debt** of the least collateralized borrowers.
- Borrowers lose **some collateral**, but **their debt is reduced** by the same amount.

> - ❌ No additional fees for redemption  
> - ⚠️ Lower rates = higher chance of redemption  
> - ✅ Higher rates = safer from redemption

## Why Choose Your Own Interest Rate?

**WeissFi's flexible interest rate system gives you unprecedented control over your borrowing costs and risk management.**

### Key Advantages:

**🎯 Competitive Rates**
- Start as low as **0.5%** interest (compared to fixed 8%+ on other protocols)
- Set rates up to **25%** based on your risk tolerance
- **You decide** what you're willing to pay

**⚖️ Strategic Risk Management**
- **Low rates (0.5%-2%)**: Minimize borrowing costs but accept redemption risk
- **Higher rates (5%+)**: Protect against redemption by contributing more to the protocol

### Smart Rate Selection Strategy:

**When to use LOW rates (0.5%-2%)**:
- Your collateral has **appreciated significantly** since borrowing
- Even if redeemed, you'd still profit from the higher collateral price
- Example: Borrowed at $1 SUI, now worth $3 - redemption would still be profitable

**When to use HIGHER rates (5%+)**:
- Your collateral has **depreciated** since borrowing  
- You want to **protect your position** from redemption
- Market conditions are volatile and you prefer stability

> **Remember**: The protocol redeems from lowest interest rate borrowers first, so higher rates = better protection.
