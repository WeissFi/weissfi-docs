# Introduction

# What is WeissFi?

**WeissFi** is a decentralized lending protocol built on the **Sui blockchain**, allowing users to borrow against their digital assets with **user-defined interest rates**.

- **Optimized Liquidations** – Stability Pools protect users from sudden liquidations while ensuring fair collateral management.
- **Seamless On-Chain Borrowing** – Leveraging Sui's high-speed, low-cost transactions, WeissFi makes decentralized lending more efficient and accessible.
