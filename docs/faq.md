# Redemptions FAQ

### What are redemptions?

**Redemptions** ensure that **DORI maintains its $1 peg** by allowing users to **swap DORI for SUI at face value**.

- If DORI falls below $1, **arbitrageurs redeem DORI for SUI**, reducing supply and helping restore the peg.
- Redemptions **start with borrowers paying the lowest interest rates**.

---

- You **do not lose USD value** â€” your **debt and collateral adjust proportionally**.
- You **keep a small redemption fee** (e.g. ~0.5%) from the redeemer.

---

### Can I protect myself from redemptions?

**Yes!**

- **Set a higher interest rate** to move further down the redemption queue.
- **Monitor DORI price** â€” if DORI is trading **above $1**, redemptions do **not occur**.

---

### Is there a fee during redemptions?

Yes â€” a **small fee (~0.5%)** is applied when someone redeems DORI for SUI.

- The fee is **not paid by you**, but is **retained in your Trove** (borrower position).
- This makes redemptions **fairer** than in other systems.

---
