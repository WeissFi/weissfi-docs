# Redemptions FAQ

### What are redemptions?

**Redemptions** ensure that **DORI maintains its $1 peg** by allowing users to **swap DORI for collateral at face value**.

- If DORI falls below $1, **arbitrageurs redeem DORI for collateral**, reducing supply and helping restore the peg.
- Redemptions **start with borrowers paying the lowest interest rates**.

---

### What happens if my loan is redeemed?

- Your **debt is reduced**, and an **equivalent amount of collateral** is used to repay the redeemer.
- You **do not lose USD value** â€” your **debt and collateral adjust proportionally**.
- The **protocol collects a redemption fee** (0.5% + dynamic rate) from your collateral, while the redeemer receives the remaining amount.

---

### Can I protect myself from redemptions?

**Yes!**

- **Set a higher interest rate** to move further down the redemption queue.
- **Monitor DORI price** â€” if DORI is trading **above $1**, redemptions do **not occur**.

---

### Is there a fee during redemptions?

Yes â€” a **small fee (0.5% + dynamic rate)** is deducted from the borrower's collateral when someone redeems DORI.

- The fee is **effectively paid by you as the borrower** through a deduction from your collateral.
- This makes redemptions **fairer** than in other systems.

---
# Additional Questions
